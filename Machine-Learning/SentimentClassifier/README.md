This project is a first experience with Machine Learning and Sickit-learn library in Python.

About the project: Machine Learning program, written in Python with Jupyter Notebook.

&bull; The program is a Text Classifier, It takes a sentence, and classifies whether its 'negative' or 'positive'.<br/>
The data used to train the models here, is a Json file of 10000 valid books reviews taken from Amazon, which required some data cleaning and arranging.
For each text comment of a review, the respective score that was given (0-5 stars) was matched. and so,
accordingly the Program learnt which comments are positive and which ones are negative.

(The model i used was Support Vector Machine since it gave the best results)
