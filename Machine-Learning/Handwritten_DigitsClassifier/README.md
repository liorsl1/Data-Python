A project with scikit-learn library,and jupyter notebook. 

About the project: A program that predicts digits according to handwritten digits pictures.

&bull;A machine learning Classifier, built with the Support Vector Machine model, that analyzes the "digits" dataset from
scikit-learn library, and predicts the digits given.


&bull; The last section demonstrates a prediction of digits on my own handwritten samples. 
As the images are being processed to be similar in shape and data parameters to the images the model trained on.
